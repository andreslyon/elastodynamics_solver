Code to solve the elastodynamics equation in a 2D semiinfinite domain with neumman and dirchlet boundary conditions
The main.py file has the solver, wich is will ask for inputs to de user.
Once solved the pde problem, main.py will create a .txt file with important parameters info. Also it will create a pvd file to vizualize the displacements field.
The pulses.py contains the surface pulses used as Neumman condition rh terms.
